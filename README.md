# Diabetes-Prediction
Diabetes is a serious health issue affecting countless individuals worldwide. Early detection is key to preventing severe complications and improving patient outcomes. In this project, I've focused on using machine learning to predict the onset of diabetes.

I experimented with several algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks. By training these models on relevant datasets, I aimed to create a predictive tool that could accurately identify individuals at risk for developing diabetes.

I evaluated the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve. My findings revealed that machine learning models, especially ensemble methods and neural networks, are highly effective in predicting diabetes. These results suggest that machine learning has the potential to revolutionize diabetes prevention and management

## Diabetes Prediction Model Development

**Key Steps:**

1. **Data Collection:** Gather relevant data (e.g., Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset).
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, normalize, and encode data.
3. **Feature Selection:** Identify important features using correlation analysis, domain knowledge, and feature importance.
4. **Model Selection and Training:** Choose suitable algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and optimize hyperparameters.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess performance using metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC) and cross-validation.
6. **Model Interpretation:** Understand feature importance and individual predictions using SHAP values.
7. **Deployment:** Create a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals.

**Goal:** Develop a reliable model to aid in early diagnosis and personalized treatment for diabetes.
